SDC260 Web Interface Design

A. Introduction
This is My Homepage, a static website built as part of my learning journey in web development. It showcases my current skills in HTML5 and CSS3, focusing on modern layout techniques like Flexbox.

I am currently a student anticipating graduation in early 2027, and I hope to apply the skills I'm learning to help keep the World Wide Web a safer space.

B. Project Features
Responsive Design: The layout adjusts for different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) using media queries.

Flexbox Navigation: The main menu uses Flexbox for clean, centered navigation.

Project Table: Displays a sample list of personal projects (Portfolio and Game Tracker).

Contact Form: A basic form layout utilizing Flexbox for easy styling (non-functional as this is a static HTML/CSS project).

C. Technologies Used
HTML5

CSS3 (including Flexbox and media queries)
